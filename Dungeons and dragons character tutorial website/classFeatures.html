    <h1>Class Features</h1>
    <div id="space">Step by Step Creating a D&D 5e Character Tutorial</div>
    <p>On your very first level in a class you sometimes get interesting abilities. As a spell caster you automatically get a few cantrips to use. You should keep track of the things that you get from your class immediately and a little into the future so that you are very familiar with what your class can do in any situation. If you know exactly what to do, you can have a very smooth play session.
