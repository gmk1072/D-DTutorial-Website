    <div id="space">Step by Step Creating a D&D 5e Character Tutorial</div>
    <p>Hi, I'm Gavin Keirstead and this is my character creation tutorial for dungeons and dragons fifth edition. I will be using a lot of information from the Player's handbook, but I can't put all of it up here for obvious reasons. If you are making a character for a campaign you are starting, I would very much suggest getting ahold of the Player's Handbook as it is the ultimate guide for everything D&D.</p>
    <p>I chose this topic because as of late I have been thinking a lot of D&D since I just started making my own campaign for my friends and myself. I have been enjoying it a lot and figured I might as well put some of the reading and knowledge seeking I've already been doing for it towards this.</p>
    <p>As far as the design goes, I remember seeing this one web page with its super simple design of just half the page using an image and it was all monochromatic. I actually really liked it and so I did my own take of it and used various D&D like images to keep most of my aesthetic under wraps. I  edited all of the source images in photoshop. It worked out really well because the background could use the same template for covering up the same amount of the image. It made it easy to find images because I could cover up the majority of them with black, so they didn't all have to be the perfect resolution.</p>
    <p>In general the navigation I used worked pretty well for what I was attempting to do, but I only attempted things that I knew I could do, I would very much have liked it to have more animation and reactive navigation. But I have no idea how to do some of that, once I learn that I'll have to come back and add those.</p>
