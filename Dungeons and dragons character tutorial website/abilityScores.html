    <h1>Ability Scores</h1>
    <div id="space">Step by Step Creating a D&D 5e Character Tutorial</div>
    <p>Ability scores are determined by rolling 4d6 and choosing the best three scores of those 4 dice.
        You have to do this for each of the 6 stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. The rolls you get each have an ability modifier that correspond, this number gets added to certain things like any ability/skill check, when attacking/doing damage, your AC, your health and other various things.

    <h3>Abilities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Used for most melee combat and for equipping heavy armor. Melee or tough fighter-like characters would use this. Skills that use this: Athletics.</li>
        <li><strong>Dexterity:</strong>Used for most ranged combat and adds to light and medium armor class. Agile characters would use this. Skills that use this: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth. </li>
        <li><strong>Constitution:</strong>Used for health pool and common durability. Anyone can make use of this but anyone that plans on getting hit would use this. No skills use this</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong>Used for some spell casting. Some mage-like characters or anyone who is meant to be smart would use this. Skills that use this: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion.</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong>Used for some spell casting. Affects passive Wisdom(perception). Older, religious, or aware characters would use this. Skills that use this: Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival.</li>
        <li><strong>Charisma:</strong>Used for some spell casting. Charming, handsome, sly, and persuasive characters would use this. Skills that use this: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I would not assign any stats until you have determined your class AND your race. The racial passives may allow you to place some stats in other locations for a more well rounded build. The class you choose will determine which stats should be your highest. For example as a rogue, you may wish to consider placing your highest stat in dexterity due to the rogue probably using medium armor, stealth, and finesse weapons</p>
